# condensed-probability-book
This book is a collection of commonly used definition and results from probability theory and statistics. It is meant as a reference book and is designed to be printed as a 6x9 book once completed. Notably, it contains:

*summaries of various properties of a number of common distributions
*commonly used theorems and results
*a summary of various statistical tests
*tables for quick calculation of values of commonly used functions
*a detailed index for quick lookup

This compilation is still a work in progress.

NOTE: As this book was originally intended for personal use only, I have not kept track of my sources throughout the writing process and as such there is no bibliography. I make no attempt to claim this work as my own. In no way did I create the content contained in this book, it is simply a compilation of the (hopefully) well-known work of others.
